    <h2>Chapter. 1 - HELPLESSNESS</h2>
    <p>The helplessness of mine confused me a lot all the time, especially these days, because I have lost my job for nearly a month. It is such helplessness which can make me awake all night long. What's worse, it is not only about the fear of losing my job, but also about the fear of the criticisms of my family, my friends, all the people passing by me, laughing at me in my eyes. I am just lost in the confusing modern life, in hundreds of extremely high buildings, lost my mind, walking by the road with the empty body.</p>
    <p>So, what cause this mess? Well, honestly, I just, made a tiny mistake. It was not a so important worksheet, so I printed it deleted it from my computer and directly wrote on it. Then, one silent midnight, with no opened light inside my house, I woke up and went to the bathroom. Because of the darkness, I fell off. I was fine, the worksheet I had just printed was not, however. Opening the light, I found the ripped paper on the floor. I could not see a single word clearly on it. Unfortunately, there are not any copies. I could not sleep that night. The second day, I bought a cup of coffee, then went to work.</p>
    <p>'Never mind, that's just an unimportant weekly financial report.' I thought.</p>
    <p>I sat down on my own chair, opened my computer, checked up all the emails, and what I found is just my boss' reminder: the expense controlling department will check our financial report, send the worksheet to me within a day.</p>
    <p>Then quickly I got fired.</p>
